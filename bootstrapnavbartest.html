After Moscow, Ricardo's father's job moved them to Doha, Qatar. In Qatar, Ricardo spent 3-years in the Doha English Speaking (British) School and 3-years at the American School of Doha.

                    Soon after graduating from high school, Ricardo ended up at the University of Texas at San Antonio after having applied to the business school at the University of Texas at Austin as his first and second-choice major. Ricardo put in 100% effort during his freshman year and ended up with a 3.9 GPA. He was one of only 2 external transfer that the McCombs School of Business at the University of Texas at Austin accepted in 2005. Once there, Ricardo pursued his degree in finance and became heavily involved with the Hispanic Business Student Association on campus. He ended up serving as an officer and met his future wife, Jenna, at one of the social events. Ricardo graduated from the University of Texas at Austin in 2008 with a degree in finance and a minor in information systems. Prior to graduating, he had received an offer to join the Media and Telecommunications Investment Banking group at Merrill Lynch in NYC.

                    Ricardo pursued his desire to work in finance and moved to New York in May of 2008. He worked at Merrill Lynch (later Bank of America Merrill Lynch) for 2.5 years. He then decided to get into the digital media industry and went to work for the Wall Street Journal as a Business Development Analyst focused on content licensing and audience development projects. He was there for 1.5 years when he was recruited away to join a small financial-media startup named InvestingChannel. Ricardo’s job was in business development, but he was quickly put to work building the firm's first ever operating model for capital raising purposes. Ricardo spent 1 year in business development at Investing Channel before he was given the opportunity to join a newly created product and technology organization at InvestingChannel. Ricardo was employee number 1 and he, along with his boss, went about creating the new team, roadmap, and all the internal processes for the group. Ricardo spent 4 additional years at InvestingChannel before he was recruited away to join Media.Net.

                    Ricardo is currently a Senior Solutions Architect for Media.Net and he has recently relocated back to Austin, TX from New York with his wife and son, Ricardo Andres. They live in southwest Austin and enjoy being back close to family and all the great food and atmosphere of Austin! Ricardo is currently enrolled in the Full-Stack Developer Bootcamp at The University of Texas at Austin to help him refine his technical skills in the hopes that we will be able to take what is taught in this class and apply it to his job to become a more astute and confident technical leader within the company.
